# Contribution Guide

Are you interested in what we are doing and would like to contribute to the project? This guide is for you. As an open source community
project, Curio needs minds from different backgrounds to continually improve the product. Are you a developer, maker, a teacher 
or a researcher? We need you! If you think you do not fit in with these  backgrounds, we still need you. You can test Curio with 
a blind school near you, with a blind friend or with yourself (also applicabe to sighted people) with our self-administered user test.

 # Collaborative Tools:
     Well workflow is key to contribution and collaboration. This is why we have agreed to use common platforms, which helps 
     everyone of us to use the same format and same workflow. 
     
     Chat: Telegram. 
     All official and unofficial announcements, sharing ideas, events and cheering up achievements happens here. If you are already 
     not on Telegram, you can get it here https://telegram.org/ 
     
     CAD: FreeCAD
     We design using the popular open source FreeCAD software. We use STEP, STL as the standard formats to push designs into the 
     repository. You can get it here https://www.freecadweb.org/
     
     3D Printing: Slic3r / Cura 
     If you want to print your own 3D models, you can use these softwares. But if you plan to use on-demand services like, 3D hubs
     usually they accept STL, IGES or STEP formats. You can get Slic3r at https://slic3r.org/download/   or Cura at 
     https://ultimaker.com/learn/simplify-3d-printing-with-ultimaker-cura-4-0
     
     Lasercutting: InkScape / Adobe Illustrator
     After you export drawing file (DWG/ PDF/ AI formats), they can be prepared for laser cutting using InkScape or Adobe Illustrator. 
     We hope to replace all drawings in the lasercutting section with InkScape, as Adobe Illustrator is not open source nor free to use. 
     
     File Storage: Google Drive
     At the moment we use Google drive to store, share and work on docs, sheets and slides. Hope to transit to anyother free services
     in the future.
     
     Schematics/ PCB Design:
     We use KiCad for electronics design and you can get it here http://kicad-pcb.org/
     
     Version Control Graphical User Interface: GitKraken
     This software utility eases things for you, when you work with git branches and provides a neat and organised representation of
     what is going on. You can find it here https://www.gitkraken.com/
     
     # Project Management
     We use project boards within the github repository to manage the workflow. The project development is divided into two phases. The
     first one concerns product development while the next phase deals with the research and learning materials associated with the 
     product. You can find more information at https://github.com/curiostudio/project_curio/blob/master/Progress/Roadmap_Curio.pdf
     
     The cards To do, In progress and Completed are automated Kanban. For instance, if a closed pull request in this project reopens, it 
     automatically move to In progress card, while newly added issues are automatically added to the To Do card. You can learn more 
     about using Project Boards at https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards

# How can I help?
Each of the below domains are what we think, could be the scope of further development. 

		- Software
    1) PyPi installation package	
        Not all users would be tech savvy with a good background in programming. This is why we need to create self- installing
        package in Raspberry Pi, so that it becomes a 'one-click to install everything' for anyone to install the necessary 
        dependencies, packages and scripts. 
			
    2) 
			- Audio tutorials
			- Audio startup messages
		- hardware
			- Better chassis design to pass fall test of 4 feet
			- Drift
			- Accurate positioning
			- Creating a compact design
			- PCB remove arduino and include only required components
			- Add haptic motors for debugging
		- User testing
			- with blind programmers
			- with blind schools (how teachers find it to teach, how children learn)
			- Ergonomics test
			- Self administered user test
		- Research
			- Multi-modal interaction	
			- Usability test with middle school children and adults	
			- Productivity benchmarking
			- Playfulness evaluation
		- Documentation
			- Open Hardware best practices
			- Troubleshooting guide
			- Collaborative design tools installation guide
			- Git tutorials

		- Teaching resources
			- Programming tutorials
			
		- Marketing and Outreach
			- Content writing
			- Kickstarter campaign
			- Market validation
			- Safety compliances
